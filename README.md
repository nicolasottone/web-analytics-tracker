## Summary

Web Analytics Tracker is a comprehensive analytics application built with Next.js, offering real-time insights into user engagement on your website. Through event tracking, page view monitoring, and visitor identification, Web Analytics Tracker empowers you to understand user behavior and optimize your website's performance. The intuitive dashboard visualizes key metrics through charts, graphs, and lists, providing a clear overview of user interactions within a specified timeframe. Leveraging Redis for data storage ensures rapid response times and a seamless user experience.

## API Use:

### Track Pageviews

By default, all current and future pages are dynamically crawled in the middleware.

```js
//middleware.ts
analytics.trackPageview(relativePath)
```

### Track Events:

You can track anything you want, just use `trackEvent` from `@/utils/client_api` and give the event a name.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => trackEvent('buttonClicked')}>Click Me</button>
```

### Track visitors metadata:

By default only geographic information is saved as metadata, but you can modify the API in `@/utils/analytics` to accept more user metadata from the middleware.

```js
//middleware.ts
analytics.trackVisitor(metadata)
```
